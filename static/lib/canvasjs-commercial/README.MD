Place your own licensed version of CanvasJS's Charts lib here to remove the "non-commercial" / copyright label.

Only the canvasjs.min.js file goes here, restart the UI server after a change.

The license can be purchased at https://canvasjs.com/license/

If this file is not found here, the "non-commerial" version from NPM is used.
